#### Computer Science Experience
I started taking computer science the summer before my freshman year at Horace Mann when I took CS1. My CS experience has thus far only been through Horace Mann. I have taken CS1, CS2, APCS(5), and now Art of Data. Until this course, I have only programmed in Java, in which my favorite program was the Optical Character Recognition assignment. Right now I am taking AP Calc AB.

#### Soccer Interest
Since I was very little, soccer has always been a passion of mine and my favorite sport. My favorite team is [Manchester United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.), I play center attacking mid, and my favorite players are:
* Bruno Fernandes
* Luka Modric
* Kevin De Bruyne

I have traveled to multiple countries to play soccer, but my favorite by far and the country that I have spent the most time in is Brazil. When I go to Brazil in the summer, I play with Palmeiras in Sao Paulo.

#### The Upcoming Year

This year, I am looking forward to being around my friends and classmates for as long as possible and having a great senior spring!

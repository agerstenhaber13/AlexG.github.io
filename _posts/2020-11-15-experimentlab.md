### Research Paper
https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/examining-debt-implications-belt-and-road-initiative-policy-perspective.pdf

This research paper examines the the ways in which China's Belt and Road Initiative puts third-world countries at risk of debt-trapping.

### Questions

1. Is the BRI effective at generating economic growth for third-world countries.
2. The population would be countries involved in the BRI that are financing infrastructure projects through Chinese loans. Helpful information would include:
* Have countries dealt with the BRI before
* Economic indicators such as inflation and GDP
* Cost of infrastructure projects and how much value they would add to domestic economies
3. The sample frame would be a percentage of the 138 countries involved in the BRI as well as countries with similar economic conditions that are not in the BRI. Only a portion of the 138 countries incur debt from the program, so it would be a percentage of those countries. Because there is a very reasonable amount of nations in the BRI to study, analyzing data from a percentage of those countries would be feasible.
4. I would use stratified sampling and seperate the countries into groups depending on how "at-risk" they are of debt trapping, according to the results of previous research. This method would ensure that each group is represented and would create clearly defined categories that don't rely on highly specific factors that are unique to each country.
5. The null hypothesis would be that the BRI is not effective at generating economic growth for third-world countries. The alternative hypothesis would be that it is.
6. The independent variables I would use would be GDP and the price of infrastructure projects. The dependent variables would be whether countries are involved in the BRI or not. The treatment, which would just pull from available data, would give different nations different amounts of debt to finance infrastructure projects. This treatment would allow me to identify the correlation between economic growth and BRI infrastructure projects/debt accumulation.
7. The control group would be the countries not in the BRI that recieve no loans from China to finance infrastructure. The experimental group would recieve money from China for infrastructure. Countries would be assigned purely based on if they are currently or have previously incurred Chinese debt through the BRI.
8. The experiment would use available data to sort the sample frame into different groups and analyze which group, the control or experimental, saw a larger portion of their countries experience economic growth. Data would be analyzed over a period of five years after the completion of infrastructure projects to ensure that the data had enough time to become representative. Moreover, in the experimental group, countries that experienced debt trapping would count negatively towards the count of countries that experienced economic growth, because their is a large difference between a country that doesn't experience economic growth and a country that experiences debt trapping, althought they can both happen at the same time. 
9. There are a lot of potential biases that could come up when collecting this data and conducting the experiment. Firstly, it will be difficult to know for certain if BRI projects are the cause of economic growth, even if they contribute to it. Secondly, nations from the control group may have alternative investments or loans coming in from other places, making it difficult to use them as a part of the control group. This could be addressed by removing such nations from the control group. Moreover, economic growth is a difficult metric to measure at times as well. To solve this, I would use GDP as an indicator. Additionally, short of China reclaiming projects through debt trapping, infrastructure projects may add value to economies in the short term but harm economies in the long term as they struggle to pay back the loans. This makes the study biased towards the short term while not accounting for longer term impacts, whether or not they are the same.

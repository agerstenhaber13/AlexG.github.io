## A Meta-Analysis of Research: The Correlation Between Arms Races and the Probability of War
 
Rider, Toby J, Michael G Findley, and Paul F Diehl. "Just Part of the Game? Arms Races, Rivalry, and War." Journal of Peace Research 48, no. 1 (2011): 85-100. Accessed October 23, 2020. http://www.jstor.org/stable/29777471.
 
### Methods
 
The authors of this research paper, Rider, Findley, and Diehl, first establish the criteria for nations that can be involved in an arms race so that they can establish their data set. They establish 4 different categories of dyads (two nations) who may be involved in an arms race with each other.
 
* Nations that have never been involved in a military dispute (29,695 dyad year observations)
* Nations that have been involved in either one or two military disputes (15,213 dyad year observations)
* Rivalry dyads (3,192 dyad year observations)
* Rivalry dyads in non-rivalry years (6,144 dyad year observations)
 
These categories themselves do not pose problems for the study, and the inclusion of the rivalry dyads in non-rivalry years helps act as a control group for the study.
 
Firstly, the criteria for an arms race in the first place is very flawed. The authors use the criteria of two politically relevant nations (i.e. geography, economic interests etc.) with diverging foreign policy interests each increasing their military spending by 8% for at least three years. There are two major issues with this criteria. Firstly, the relationship between a nation increasing its military spending by 8% per year and one increasing by 30% per year should not be characterized as an arms race because they are clearly not matching each other's increases. Additionally, solely using percentage increases as criteria is problematic because it ignores the monetary value of the increase. Using the authors' methods, if the United States and Honduras, which are geographically relevant, had diverging foreign policy objectives and were each increasing military spending by 8% annually, an arms race would be detected. The problem here is obvious, 8% of the US' military spending is far greater than 8% of Honduras'. For this reason, the US does not need to increase its military spending to compete with Honduras, and thus is not engaging in an arms race.
 
Moreover, another key problem with the methodology of identifying arms races is the use of dyads only. Although it is common for arms races to occur between two nations, it is also possible for them to occur between more than two nations or even regionally. By only analyzing dyads, instances of arms races will be overcounted. This is because even though an arms race between three parties may only be motivated by two of the parties (i.e. one nation is only really racing against one other nation and one nation is simultaneously involved in two arms races), three arms races will be counted. Additionally, overcounting will occur when two independent dyads are each involved in arms races simultaneously, resulting in two nations that meet the criteria for an arms race being counted as an arms race even though they are not motivated by each other.
 
### Findings
 
I do not take issue with the central findings of this study, which focus on the differences in arms race-induced war between the different types of dyads outlined above. The authors conclude that rivalry dyads see a greater increase in the probability of war in the event of an arms race which is a relatively intuitive and well supported conclusion. I would, however, estimate that the probability increase is slightly high. Because of the analysis made above that assumes that there are many instances of false positives due to the criteria for an arms race, arms races will be overcounted. This means that, considering that the criteria for armed conflict is generally uncontroversial, although the amount of armed conflicts will remain constant, the amount of arms races will be lower than the authors represent. This will increase the percentage of arms races that do actually lead to armed conflict or war. Overall, I would conclude that the probability of an arms race leading to armed conflict, for all categories of dyads, is likely higher than the authors conclude.
 
### Publish or Perish
 
I would argue that because of the above criticisms, publish or perish likely had a small effect on the integrity of this study. If the three authors of this study wanted to increase their chances of being published, they would most likely inflate the findings to create a more significant result. However, as I outline, the authors most likely underrepresented the actual phenomenon and thus decreased the significance of their article. Moreover, in their conclusion, state that their findings align well with much of the previous research done on this topic. Including this analysis likely decreases the likelihood that their work will be published because it is similar in findings to previous works, but they include it nevertheless.

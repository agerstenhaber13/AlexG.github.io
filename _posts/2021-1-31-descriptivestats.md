### Dataset

I worked with the Covid Vaccinations by Country dataset. I worked with David on this lab. I also imported pandas to be able to analyze the data using summary statistics and display the histogram.

### Analysis

I used the python libraries to make a histogram of the data and show summary statistics. I analyzed the different data for daily vaccinations per million in five different countries: Israel, Chile, Canada, Italy, and Luxembourg. What I noticed was a drastic increase in the amount of vaccinations in Israel compared to other developed nations. There was great variability from the center in this case, but the dropoff was steep and consistent amongst the other nations I evaluated. 

### Conclusions

What I can see from this dataset is that even amongst developed nations, the vaccination rates still differ wildly. Although Israel's daily vaccinations per million were over 10,000, Italy's were just over 2,000. This data indicates that there are many and much more important factors than raw vaccination statistics, and that certain countries with very developed infrastructure for healthcare will be more succesful in vaccinating the general population.
